/*
A derived class object can be assigned to a base class object, but the other way
is not possible. Object slicing happens when a derived class object is assigned
to a base class object, additional attributes of a derived class object are
sliced off to form the base class object.

We can avoid above unexpected behavior with the use of pointers or references.
Object slicing doesnâ€™t occur when pointers or references to objects are passed
as function arguments since a pointer or reference of any type takes same amount
of memory
