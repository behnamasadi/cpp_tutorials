## Big-endian, Little-endian
"big-endian" and "little-endian" are terms that describe the order in which bytes are arranged within a binary representation of a number.

- **Big-endian**: The most significant byte (the "big end") is stored at the smallest memory address.
- **Little-endian**: The least significant byte (the "little end") is stored at the smallest memory address.

Here's a simple C++ example to illustrate big-endian byte order:

1. **Understand the concept**: Let's consider the integer `0x12345678`. In big-endian order, this integer is stored in memory as:

   ```
   Address    Value
   0x00       12
   0x01       34
   0x02       56
   0x03       78
   ```

2. **Code Example**:
   Below is a simple C++ program that shows how to determine if your system is big-endian and how to manually interpret an integer as big-endian.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Function to check if the system is big-endian
bool isBigEndian() {
    unsigned int test = 1;
    char *byte = (char*)&test;
    return byte[0] == 0;
}

// Function to print bytes of an integer
void printBytes(int value) {
    unsigned char *bytes = (unsigned char*)&value;
    for (size_t i = 0; i < sizeof(int); ++i) {
        std::cout << std::hex << (int)bytes[i] << " ";
    }
    std::cout << std::dec << std::endl;
}

int main() {
    int number = 0x12345678;
    
    std::cout << "System is " << (isBigEndian() ? "Big-endian" : "Little-endian") << std::endl;
    
    std::cout << "Original integer: 0x" << std::hex << number << std::dec << std::endl;
    
    std::cout << "Bytes in memory: ";
    printBytes(number);
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **isBigEndian Function**:
   - We create an unsigned integer `test` with a value of `1`.
   - We then cast the address of `test` to a `char*` (pointer to a byte).
   - If the first byte (`byte[0]`) is `0`, it means the most significant byte is at the lowest address, indicating a big-endian system.

2. **printBytes Function**:
   - This function prints out the bytes of an integer.
   - We cast the address of the integer to an `unsigned char*` to access individual bytes.
   - We then print each byte in hexadecimal format.

3. **main Function**:
   - We define an integer `number` with the value `0x12345678`.
   - We check and print whether the system is big-endian or little-endian.
   - We print the original integer in hexadecimal format.
   - We call `printBytes` to print the bytes of the integer as they are stored in memory.

When you run this program, it will tell you whether your system is big-endian or little-endian and show you the byte order of the integer `0x12345678` in memory.




In a little-endian system, the least significant byte is stored at the smallest memory address. For the integer `0x12345678`, this means that the bytes are stored in reverse order compared to a big-endian system.

Hereâ€™s how `0x12345678` would be stored in memory on a little-endian system:

```
Address    Value
0x00       78
0x01       56
0x02       34
0x03       12
```

Let's update the previous C++ example to include a demonstration of this. We'll add a function to print the bytes in both big-endian and little-endian formats to make the difference clear:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Function to check if the system is big-endian
bool isBigEndian() {
    unsigned int test = 1;
    char *byte = (char*)&test;
    return byte[0] == 0;
}

// Function to print bytes of an integer in the current system's endian format
void printSystemBytes(int value) {
    unsigned char *bytes = (unsigned char*)&value;
    for (size_t i = 0; i < sizeof(int); ++i) {
        std::cout << std::hex << (int)bytes[i] << " ";
    }
    std::cout << std::dec << std::endl;
}

// Function to print bytes of an integer in big-endian format
void printBigEndianBytes(int value) {
    unsigned char *bytes = (unsigned char*)&value;
    for (int i = sizeof(int) - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
        std::cout << std::hex << (int)bytes[i] << " ";
    }
    std::cout << std::dec << std::endl;
}

int main() {
    int number = 0x12345678;
    
    std::cout << "System is " << (isBigEndian() ? "Big-endian" : "Little-endian") << std::endl;
    
    std::cout << "Original integer: 0x" << std::hex << number << std::dec << std::endl;
    
    std::cout << "Bytes in system's endian format: ";
    printSystemBytes(number);
    
    std::cout << "Bytes in big-endian format: ";
    printBigEndianBytes(number);
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **printSystemBytes Function**:
   - This function prints out the bytes of an integer as they are stored in the current system's endian format.
   - It accesses the bytes by casting the address of the integer to an `unsigned char*` and prints each byte in hexadecimal format.

2. **printBigEndianBytes Function**:
   - This function prints the bytes of the integer in big-endian format, regardless of the system's actual byte order.
   - It iterates through the bytes in reverse order to simulate big-endian storage.

3. **main Function**:
   - Defines an integer `number` with the value `0x12345678`.
   - Checks and prints whether the system is big-endian or little-endian.
   - Prints the original integer in hexadecimal format.
   - Calls `printSystemBytes` to print the bytes in the system's endian format.
   - Calls `printBigEndianBytes` to print the bytes in big-endian format.

### Output Example:
On a little-endian system, the output might look like this:
```
System is Little-endian
Original integer: 0x12345678
Bytes in system's endian format: 78 56 34 12 
Bytes in big-endian format: 12 34 56 78 
```

On a big-endian system, the output might look like this:
```
System is Big-endian
Original integer: 0x12345678
Bytes in system's endian format: 12 34 56 78 
Bytes in big-endian format: 12 34 56 78 
```

This shows how the bytes of `0x12345678` are stored in memory on both little-endian and big-endian systems.
