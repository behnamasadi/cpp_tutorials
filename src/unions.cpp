 Union declaration

 Unions allow one same portion of memory to be accessed as different data types,
 since all of them are in fact the same location in memory.

 Each one with a different data type. Since all of them are referring to the
 same location in memory, the modification of one of the elements will affect
 the value of all of them. We cannot store different values in them independent
 of each other.

 One of the uses a union may have is to unite an elementary type with an array
 or structures of smaller elements. For example:

    union mix_t

 defines three names that allow us to access the same group of 4 bytes: mix.l,
 mix.s and mix.c and which we can use according to how we want to access these
 bytes, as if they were a single long-type data, as if they were two short
 elements or as an array of char elements, respectively.

 I have mixed types, arrays and structures in the union so that you can see the
 different ways that we can access the data. For a little-endian system (most PC
 platforms), this union could be represented as:
     ---------------------
 mix |    |    |    |    |
     ---------------------
             mix.i
      mix.s.hi   mix.s.hi
      c[0] c[1] c[2] c[4]

int main() {

  mix_t mix;

  // 00000001000000010000000100000001
  mix.uc[0] = 1;
  mix.uc[1] = 1;
  mix.uc[2] = 1;
  mix.uc[3] = 1;

  std::cout << mix.ui << std::endl;
  std::cout << std::bitset<8 * sizeof(mix_t)>(mix.ui) << std::endl;

  std::bitset<8 * sizeof(mix_t)> union_bitset;
  union_bitset[0] = 1;
  union_bitset[8] = 1;
  union_bitset[16] = 1;
  union_bitset[24] = 1;
  std::cout << union_bitset.to_ulong() << std::endl;
  std::cout << union_bitset.to_string() << std::endl;
  //     std::cout<<sizeof(unsigned int)  <<std::endl;
  return 0;
}
