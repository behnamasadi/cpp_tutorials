**Understanding `std::not1` and `std::unary_negate`**

### What are they?
* **`std::not1`**: This is a helper function that creates a function object which negates the result of another unary predicate. It's essentially a logical NOT for functions.
* **`std::unary_negate`**: This is a function object wrapper that inverts the result of the wrapped unary predicate. It's the underlying type returned by `std::not1`.

### Simple Example
Let's say we have a vector of integers and we want to count how many numbers are greater than or equal to 5.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <functional>

int main() {
    std::vector<int> numbers = {2, 5, 8, 1, 7, 4};

    // Using std::not1 and lambda
    auto is_less_than_5 = [](int x) { return x < 5; };
    int count_greater_or_equal_to_5 = std::count_if(numbers.begin(), numbers.end(), std::not1(is_less_than_5));

    std::cout << "Count of numbers greater than or equal to 5: " << count_greater_or_equal_to_5 << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation
1. We create a lambda expression `is_less_than_5` that checks if a number is less than 5.
2. We use `std::not1` to negate the result of `is_less_than_5`. This effectively creates a predicate that checks if a number is greater than or equal to 5.
3. We use `std::count_if` to count the number of elements in the vector that satisfy the negated predicate.

### Key Points
* `std::not1` is a convenience function to create a negated predicate.
* `std::unary_negate` is the underlying type and can be used directly, but `std::not1` is often more convenient.
* These functions are useful when you need to invert the logic of an existing predicate without rewriting it.
