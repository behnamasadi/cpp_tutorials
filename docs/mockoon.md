## Mockoon
Mockoon is a tool for simulating APIs, allowing you to create mock REST APIs for testing purposes without needing to connect to the actual backend services. Integrating Mockoon with a C++ project could be useful for testing or developing client-side applications that consume APIs.

Here’s an example of how to use Mockoon with a simple C++ program:

### Step 1: Set up Mockoon

1. **Download and install Mockoon** from the [Mockoon website](https://mockoon.com/).
2. **Create a mock API**:
   - Launch Mockoon and click on "New Environment".
   - Add a new route (e.g., `GET /api/v1/test`) and set the response body to a JSON object like this:
     ```json
     {
       "message": "Hello from Mockoon!"
     }
     ```
   - Set the response code to `200 OK`.
   - Start the server by clicking on the "Play" button.

   Mockoon will provide you with a port (e.g., `3001`) where the mock server is running.

### Step 2: Write a C++ client to interact with the Mockoon API

You can use a library like `libcurl` or `Boost.Beast` to make HTTP requests in C++. In this example, I’ll use `libcurl` for simplicity.

1. **Install libcurl**:
   - On Windows, you can install `libcurl` using vcpkg: `vcpkg install curl`.

2. **Write the C++ program**:
   Here's an example of a simple C++ program that interacts with your Mockoon mock API using `libcurl`.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <curl/curl.h>

size_t WriteCallback(void* contents, size_t size, size_t nmemb, std::string* s) {
    size_t newLength = size * nmemb;
    s->append((char*)contents, newLength);
    return newLength;
}

int main() {
    CURL* curl;
    CURLcode res;
    std::string response;

    curl_global_init(CURL_GLOBAL_DEFAULT);
    curl = curl_easy_init();

    if (curl) {
        curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, "http://localhost:3001/api/v1/test");
        curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_WRITEFUNCTION, WriteCallback);
        curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_WRITEDATA, &response);

        res = curl_easy_perform(curl);

        if (res != CURLE_OK) {
            std::cerr << "curl_easy_perform() failed: " << curl_easy_strerror(res) << std::endl;
        } else {
            std::cout << "Response from Mockoon: " << response << std::endl;
        }

        curl_easy_cleanup(curl);
    }

    curl_global_cleanup();
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Mockoon Setup**:
   - Mockoon is running a mock server on `localhost:3001`.
   - The route `/api/v1/test` returns a JSON response with a `message`.

2. **C++ Program**:
   - This C++ program uses `libcurl` to send an HTTP GET request to the mock API.
   - The `WriteCallback` function collects the response data and stores it in the `response` string, which is then printed.

### Step 3: Run the C++ Program

1. Start the Mockoon server.
2. Compile the C++ program. If you are using g++ with libcurl installed, you can compile it like this:

```bash
g++ -o test_program test_program.cpp -lcurl
```

3. Run the compiled program:

```bash
./test_program
```

You should see output similar to:

```
Response from Mockoon: {"message":"Hello from Mockoon!"}
```

### Benefits:
- **Mockoon** helps simulate various scenarios, such as API timeouts or error responses, allowing you to test your C++ client code without relying on a real server.
- **libcurl** is a lightweight library for making HTTP requests from C++.

This example shows how you can mock an API using Mockoon and then interact with it using a C++ client, making it useful for testing network-based applications in C++.
