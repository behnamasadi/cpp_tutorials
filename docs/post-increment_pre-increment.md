## Post-increment, Pre-increment

**Understanding num++ and +num:**

- **num++ (Post-increment):** Increments the value of `num` after the expression is evaluated.
- **+num (Unary plus):** Returns the value of `num` without modifying it.

**Cases where num++ and +num differ and cause different output:**

1. **In expressions involving assignment:**
   - **Example:**
     ```c++
     int num = 5;
     int result1 = num++; // result1 will be 5, num will be 6
     int result2 = +num; // result2 will be 6, num will remain 6
     ```
   - **Explanation:**
     - In the first case, `result1` gets the original value of `num` (5), and then `num` is incremented to 6.
     - In the second case, `result2` simply gets the current value of `num`, which is 6, without modifying it.

2. **In function calls as arguments:**
   - **Example:**
     ```c++
     void printValue(int value) {
         cout << value << endl;
     }

     int num = 5;
     printValue(num++); // Will print 5
     printValue(+num); // Will print 6
     ```
   - **Explanation:**
     - In the first case, the value of `num` (5) is passed to the function before it's incremented.
     - In the second case, the value of `num` (6) is passed to the function directly.

3. **In expressions involving logical operators:**
   - **Example:**
     ```c++
     int num = 0;
     bool result1 = num++ && false; // result1 will be false
     bool result2 = +num && false; // result2 will be false
     ```
   - **Explanation:**
     - In the first case, `num++` evaluates to 0, which is considered false in a logical context. Since the first operand is false, the entire expression is false.
     - In the second case, `+num` evaluates to 0, which is still false. However, the evaluation of the second operand (false) is not necessary due to short-circuiting.

4. **In expressions involving the comma operator:**
   - **Example:**
     ```c++
     int num = 5;
     int result1 = num++, num++; // result1 will be 6
     int result2 = +num, +num; // result2 will be 6
     ```
   - **Explanation:**
     - In the first case, the first `num++` evaluates to 5, and then the second `num++` evaluates to 6. The result of the comma expression is the value of the second operand, which is 6.
     - In the second case, both `+num` expressions evaluate to 6, but the result of the comma expression is still the value of the second operand, which is 6.

**Key points to remember:**

- The difference between `num++` and `+num` lies in when the increment occurs.
- `num++` increments the value after the expression is evaluated, while `+num` does not modify the value.
- The choice between `num++` and `+num` depends on the desired behavior in the specific context.

By understanding these cases and their implications, you can effectively use `num++` and `+num` in your C++ code to achieve the intended results.
