Function objects (aka "functors"), Functors are objects that can be treated as
they are a function or function pointer You could write code that looks like
this:


myFunctorClass functor;
functor( 1, 2, 3 );


This code works because C++ allows you to overload operator(), the "function
call" operator. The function call operator can take any number of arguments of
any types and return anything it wishes to. For ease of discussion, when an
object's operator() is invoked, I'll refer to it as "calling" the object as
though it were a function being called.

#include <iostream>

class myFunctorClass {
public:
  myFunctorClass(int x) : _x(x) {}
  int operator()(int y) { return _x + y; }

private:
  int _x;
};

int main() {
  myFunctorClass addFive(5);
  std::cout << addFive(6);

  return 0;
}
