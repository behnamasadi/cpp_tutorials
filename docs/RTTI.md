# Run-Time Type Information (RTTI)
Run-Time Type Information (RTTI) is a feature provided by some programming languages, most notably C++, that allows the type of an object to be determined during program execution. RTTI is useful in situations where the type of an object is not known at compile time and needs to be determined at run time. Here's a brief overview of its key aspects:

1. **Dynamic Type Identification**: RTTI allows a program to identify the actual type of object pointed to by a base pointer. This is particularly useful in the context of inheritance and polymorphism, where a base class pointer might actually refer to an object of a derived class.

2. **`typeid` Operator**: In C++, RTTI is often used via the `typeid` operator. This operator can be applied to objects, and it returns a reference to a `type_info` object that represents the type of the object. For example, `typeid(x)` returns the `type_info` of `x`.

3. **`dynamic_cast` Operator**: Another key component of RTTI is the `dynamic_cast` operator. It is used for safely converting pointers and references within an inheritance hierarchy. Unlike `static_cast`, `dynamic_cast` performs type checking at runtime and ensures that the cast is safe. If the cast is not possible, `dynamic_cast` returns a null pointer when used with pointers, or throws a `bad_cast` exception when used with references.

4. **Use Cases and Limitations**:
   - **Use Cases**: RTTI is useful in implementations that require knowledge of object types at runtime, like in designing generic containers, serialization/deserialization, and implementing dynamic polymorphism beyond what is achievable with virtual functions.
   - **Limitations**: The use of RTTI can lead to a slight overhead in terms of performance and memory usage. Some programming environments allow RTTI to be disabled to optimize performance.

5. **Controversy and Alternatives**: While RTTI provides dynamic type information capabilities, its use is sometimes debated among developers. Some argue that excessive use of RTTI may indicate a design problem in the application. Alternatives like visitor patterns, type tags, and dynamic interfaces are often used in place of RTTI to achieve similar functionality with potentially less overhead or more controlled type-handling mechanisms.

A common scenario where RTTI is useful involves polymorphic class hierarchies, where you need to perform specific operations based on the actual type of the object at runtime. Let's consider a classic example in C++ involving a base class and multiple derived classes.

### Scenario:
Imagine we have a class hierarchy for different types of media content, like `Audio`, `Video`, and `Image`, all derived from a base class `Media`. We have a function that takes a pointer to `Media` and needs to perform certain actions depending on whether the actual object is `Audio`, `Video`, or `Image`.

### Example Code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <typeinfo>

// Base class
class Media {
public:
    virtual ~Media() = default; // Virtual destructor for proper cleanup
};

// Derived classes
class Audio : public Media {};
class Video : public Media {};
class Image : public Media {};

// Function that uses RTTI
void processMedia(Media* media) {
    if (typeid(*media) == typeid(Audio)) {
        std::cout << "Processing Audio content." << std::endl;
        // Specific audio processing
    } else if (typeid(*media) == typeid(Video)) {
        std::cout << "Processing Video content." << std::endl;
        // Specific video processing
    } else if (typeid(*media) == typeid(Image)) {
        std::cout << "Processing Image content." << std::endl;
        // Specific image processing
    } else {
        std::cout << "Unknown Media type." << std::endl;
    }
}

int main() {
    Media* media1 = new Audio();
    Media* media2 = new Video();
    Media* media3 = new Image();

    processMedia(media1);
    processMedia(media2);
    processMedia(media3);

    delete media1;
    delete media2;
    delete media3;

    return 0;
}
```

In this example:

- The `processMedia` function receives a pointer to a `Media` object.
- It uses the `typeid` operator to determine the actual type of the object it received.
- Based on the type, it performs type-specific processing (in this example, it just prints a message, but you can imagine more complex operations).
- This allows us to write generic code that can handle different types of derived objects differently at runtime.

### Points to Note:
- RTTI works only with polymorphic classes (those with at least one virtual function). Here, the virtual destructor in the `Media` class makes it polymorphic.
- The `typeid` operator returns a reference to a `std::type_info` object that represents the type.
- It's crucial to handle the memory correctly to avoid memory leaks (`delete` is used in this example).
- While RTTI provides flexibility, it's advisable to use it judiciously, as over-reliance on type checking can lead to less maintainable code and could indicate potential design issues.




Now you might ask the above example can be solved if we make a virtual function `processMedia` in the Media  and implement it in the `Audio`, `Video`, and `Image`, can you make an example where we really need RTTI 

Thats's correct that the previous example can be more elegantly solved using virtual functions. A scenario where RTTI really becomes necessary is when dealing with complex class hierarchies where the behavior cannot be resolved through virtual functions alone, or when dealing with third-party library classes where you can't modify the base class to add virtual functions. Let's consider a more nuanced example:

### Scenario:
Suppose we have a graphical user interface (GUI) framework with a base class `Widget`. From `Widget`, we derive several classes like `Button`, `TextBox`, `Slider`, etc. Now, we have a function that needs to adjust the layout or perform specific actions depending on the type of widget, but without altering the base `Widget` class (perhaps because it's part of a third-party library).

### Example Code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <typeinfo>

// Base class
class Widget {
public:
    virtual ~Widget() = default;
};

// Derived classes
class Button : public Widget {};
class TextBox : public Widget {};
class Slider : public Widget {};

// Function to adjust layout based on widget type
void adjustLayout(std::vector<Widget*>& widgets) {
    for (auto* widget : widgets) {
        if (typeid(*widget) == typeid(Button)) {
            std::cout << "Adjusting layout for Button." << std::endl;
            // Button-specific layout adjustments
        } else if (typeid(*widget) == typeid(TextBox)) {
            std::cout << "Adjusting layout for TextBox." << std::endl;
            // TextBox-specific layout adjustments
        } else if (typeid(*widget) == typeid(Slider)) {
            std::cout << "Adjusting layout for Slider." << std::endl;
            // Slider-specific layout adjustments
        } else {
            std::cout << "Unknown Widget type." << std::endl;
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    std::vector<Widget*> widgets;

    widgets.push_back(new Button());
    widgets.push_back(new TextBox());
    widgets.push_back(new Slider());

    adjustLayout(widgets);

    for (auto* widget : widgets) {
        delete widget;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

In this example:

- The `adjustLayout` function needs to make specific adjustments based on the type of widget. This could be a scenario where the base class `Widget` cannot be modified to include virtual functions for layout adjustment.
- The function iterates over a collection of widgets and uses RTTI to determine each widget's type.
- Depending on the type, it performs specific actions (e.g., layout adjustments).

### Points to Note:
- RTTI is particularly useful in scenarios where the class hierarchy is complex, and the behavior depends on more than just a single method call.
- This kind of usage is common in frameworks or systems where you're extending or interacting with a codebase that you cannot modify (like third-party libraries).
- The example demonstrates a situation where the behavior cannot be encapsulated within virtual functions, necessitating RTTI for type-specific behavior.
