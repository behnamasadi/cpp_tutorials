To achieve conditional compilation in C++ based on a value from CMake, you can define a macro in your CMake configuration and then use that macro in your C++ code with preprocessor directives. Here's a step-by-step guide:

### Step 1: Define a Macro in CMakeLists.txt

In your `CMakeLists.txt` file, you can set a macro using the `add_definitions` function or `target_compile_definitions` if you want to set it for a specific target. For example:

```cmake
# Set a macro in CMake
add_definitions(-DMY_FEATURE=1)
```

Or for a specific target:

```cmake
# Assuming your target is named 'my_app'
target_compile_definitions(my_app PRIVATE -DMY_FEATURE=1)
```

### Step 2: Use the Macro in C++ Code

In your C++ code, you can now use this macro to conditionally compile code. The macro `MY_FEATURE` will be defined as `1` in this case, and you can check its value using preprocessor directives.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    #ifdef MY_FEATURE
    #if MY_FEATURE == 1
        std::cout << "Feature is enabled." << std::endl;
    #else
        std::cout << "Feature is disabled." << std::endl;
    #endif
    #else
        std::cout << "MY_FEATURE is not defined." << std::endl;
    #endif

    return 0;
}
```

### Understanding the Process

- **CMake Configuration**: In `CMakeLists.txt`, you define a macro using `add_definitions` or `target_compile_definitions`. This macro will be passed to the compiler as a preprocessor definition.
  
- **Conditional Compilation in C++**: In your C++ source code, you use preprocessor directives (`#ifdef`, `#if`, `#else`, `#endif`) to check whether the macro is defined and, if so, what its value is. Based on these checks, certain parts of the code will be compiled.

### Example Scenario

Suppose you have a feature that should only be included in a debug build. You can set a macro in CMake based on the build type and then use it in your C++ code to conditionally compile debug-specific code.

`CMakeLists.txt`:
```cmake
if(CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE STREQUAL "Debug")
    add_definitions(-DDEBUG_FEATURE=1)
endif()
```

C++ Code:
```cpp
#ifdef DEBUG_FEATURE
    std::cout << "Debug feature is active." << std::endl;
#endif
```

In this setup, the debug feature-related code in your C++ source will only be compiled if the build type is set to Debug in CMake. This is a typical use case for conditional compilation in combination with build system configurations.
